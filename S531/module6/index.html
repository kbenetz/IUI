            <p>Hello! My name is Katie, and I am an MLIS student at IUI.</p>
            <p>After many of you begged and pleaded, I acquiesced and made a site.</p>
            <p>This is the ONE and ONLY place on the web where you can learn more about me. Feel free to explore this site and read about my interests and my beloved dog, Channi. Perhaps in the future I will post some of my many interesting opinions because I know that’s what the people want. For now, enjoy!</p>
